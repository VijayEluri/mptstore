  <h2><a name="intro">1. What is MPTStore?</a></h2>
  <p>
    MPTStore is a Java library for projects that need persistent, 
    transaction-capable storage and querying of very large quantities 
    of RDF data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary areas of focus are scalability and transaction
    safety with simple query support.  Complex query support
    (a subset of SPARQL features) is in development and looks
    very promising.  Out of scope features include reasoning 
    (inference) and quads.
  </p>
  <p>
    MPTStore is implemented as a lightweight layer on top of JDBC.
    It was originally developed using Postgres as the underlying
    database, but be easily made to work with other databases
    by writing a <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/core/DDLGenerator.html">
    DDLGenerator</a>.  
  </p>

  <h2><a name="diff">2. How does it differ from existing approaches?</a></h2>
  <p>
The traditional way of storing RDF in a relational database
is to use a "big table of triples".  Variations on this basic 
approach are employed by popular RDF storage engines including 
<a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena</a>, 
<a href="http://www.openrdf.org/">Sesame</a>,
and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/threestore/">3store</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
Our approach, MPT ("Mapped Predicate Tables"),
is different.  Recognizing that the number of
relationship types in real RDF data is much
lower than the number of nodes, MPT distributes
triples across several tables, each holding all
the relationships of a certain type.  This 
design offers efficient query plans for complex
queries as well as an opportunity to scale 
across storage devices.

      <li> To configure logging:
        <ul>
          <li> If you don't already have Log4J set up for your project,
               edit the included <code>log4j.xml</code> and make sure 
               it's in your CLASSPATH.  For some help with Log4J configuration,
               see the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/logging-log4j/Log4jXmlFormat">
               Log4J XML Configuration Primer</a>.</li>
          <li> If you're already using Log4J, add MPTStore logging

  <h2><a name="api">4. API Documentation</a></h2>
<p>
  The main interface you work with is the
  <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/core/DatabaseAdaptor.html">DatabaseAdaptor</a>.
  This interface allows you to add and delete triples and execute RDF
  queries.
</p>
  The only current implementation of this interface is 
  <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/core/GenericDatabaseAdaptor.html">GenericDatabaseAdaptor</a>.
  In order to construct one, you'll need a 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html">JDBC
  DataSource</a> (which your application must provide on it's own), and a
  <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/core/DDLGenerator.html">DDLGenerator</a>.
</p>  
<p>
  A <code>DDLGenerator</code> tells MPTStore how to create and drop tables for
  a particular database type.  Existing implementations include:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/impl/derby/DerbyDDLGenerator.html">DerbyDDLGenerator</a></li>
    <li> <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/impl/h2/H2DDLGenerator.html">H2DDLGenerator</a></li>
    <li> <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/impl/postgres/PostgresDDLGenerator.html">PostgresDDLGenerator</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>
  Once you have a <code>DataSource</code> and a <code>DDLGenerator</code>,
  you can construct a <a href="api/org/nsdl/mptstore/core/BasicTableManager.html">BasicTableManager</a>,
  which can then be used to construct a <code>GenericDatabaseAdaptor</code>.

  for more detailed information.

  <ul>
  <li>
    Literal values are not normalized.  Applications should take
    care to pre-normalize the value parts of the literals before
    adding them, if normalization is required.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unbound predicate queries are relatively slow when the graph
    contains statements using many (hundreds of) distinct predicates.
    Here are some ideas we might employ to address this.
    <ol>
      <li> Storage of every triple in a complete triple
           table in addition to the predicate-specific tables.
           This would increase storage requirements 2x to 3x.
           In addition, update throughput would be reduced
           to at least half to a third.  Portions of queries
           with unbound predicates would use this table,
           while bound predicate portions would still get
           the performance benefit of going against the
           predicate-specific tables.
      </li>
      <li> In an environment where overhead of a complete triple 
           table is not desired, another option is to parallelize the 
           queries on each table.
           In the general case, this requires a connection per
           execution thread and thus, consistency would
           be difficult to enforce at the database level
           using transactions.  One solution to this problem
           is to block writes while the necessary group of 
           reading connections are beginning their transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another idea is to have something like a complete triple table,
        except it would contain references to predicates (not the actual
        text), and references to the row# in the predicate for each triple.
        This information could be used to know the exact subset of 
        predicate tables that need to be queried to form the list of
        triples for a particular subject.
        Call this the "S,P,row" approach.  The advantage over #1
        would be reduced storage space.  The disadvantage would be
        more overhead for updates.

    These can be automatically checked using the "ant checkstyle"

    but may generate warnings.  Most tests generate errors.
    Warnings are generated for the following:

      <li> Javadoc problems.  These must be fixed before a release.</li>
      <li> Inline TODO comments.  
           These should be addressed before a (1.0+) point release by either
