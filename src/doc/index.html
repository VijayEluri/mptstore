  <h2><a name="intro">1. What is MPTStore?</a></h2>
  <p>
    MPTStore is a Java library for projects that need persistent, 
    transaction-capable storage and querying of very large quantities 
    of RDF data.
  </p>
  <p>
    MPTStore is implemented as a lightweight layer on top of JDBC.
    It was developed and tested using Postgres as the underlying
    database, but can be easily adapted to work with other RDBMS 
    engines.
  </p>

<div class="sec2">
  <h2><a name="diff">2. How does it differ from existing approaches?</a></h2>
  <p>
The traditional way of storing RDF in a relational database
is to use a "big table of triples".  Variations on this basic 
approach are employed by popular RDF storage engines including 
<a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena</a>, 
<a href="http://www.openrdf.org/">Sesame</a>,
and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/threestore/">3store</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
Our approach, MPT ("Mapped Predicate Tables"),
is different.  Recognizing that the number of
relationship types in real RDF data is much
lower than the number of nodes, MPT distributes
triples across several tables, each holding all
the relationships of a certain type.  This offers
an obvious opportunity to scale across multiple
storage devices.
  </p>
  <p>
Although we have initially focused on supporting
simple queries, we believe that the efficiency
of query plans for complex RDF queries can be
much higher with MPT than with the "big table
of triples" approach.

  <h2><a name="issues">5. Known Issues / Bugs</a></h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Unbound predicate queries are relatively slow when the graph
    contains statements using many distinct predicates.
  </li>
  </ul>
